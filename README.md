🚀 MERN Admin Dashboard

A modern, full-stack admin analytics platform designed to provide real-time business insights, intelligent dashboards, and advanced data visualization. Built with MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js (MERN) — this project is optimized for both functionality and performance.

With fully responsive design, interactive charts, and server-driven data handling, this dashboard is perfect for managing and visualizing business operations across departments.

✨ Features

✅ Fully Responsive Admin Dashboard – Optimized for mobile, tablet, and desktop.✅ Advanced Data Modeling – Built with Mongoose schemas and entity relationships.✅ MongoDB Aggregation – Complex calculations done directly in the database.✅ Real-Time Data Visualization – Line, Pie, and Geo charts with Nivo.js.✅ Server-Side Pagination – Fast table loads with MongoDB + RTK Query.✅ Dark/Light Mode UI – Dynamic theme toggle using Material UI.✅ Role-Based Data Access – Modular routes and dynamic data rendering.✅ Production Deployment – Hosted backend and frontend via Render.com.

📌 All data and layout are customizable, scalable, and production-ready.

🚀 Why This Stands Out

This isn’t just a template — it’s a professional-grade admin system. Designed for recruiters, developers, and engineers who want to demonstrate:

Mastery of the MERN stack

Practical usage of Redux Toolkit Query

Backend intelligence using MongoDB aggregate pipelines

Clean, maintainable UI with Material UI

Full deployment setup with .env and production configs

Everything is production-ready and suitable for your portfolio, freelance clients, or job interviews.

🧠 Data Models

User

Product + ProductStat

Transaction

OverallStat

AffiliateStat

Modeled and related using Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERDs).
