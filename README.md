## 🧩 Data Modeling – ER Diagram

Before building the API and database logic, the entire backend was structured using an **Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)**. This helped define clear references, normalized collections, and smart aggregation pipelines.

> The ERD visualizes how `Users`, `Transactions`, `Products`, `Stats`, and `AffiliateSales` interact with each other using references and MongoDB relations.
